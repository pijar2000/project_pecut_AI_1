# Project Analysis With Master Hilmi

### Business Understanding

At this stage, the main focus is to understand the business problem being addressed.
The dataset comes from an e-commerce platform that aims to evaluate whether the changes they implemented actually produce a positive impact on performance.

To answer this question, the company conducted five experiments, which are provided as five separate files (test_1 to test_5).
Each file represents a different experiment that will be analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the applied changes.

### Data Understanding

The next step is understanding the structure and characteristics of the data.

Key observations:

- No duplicate cleaning is required, as each session_id and user_id combination is unique, with no identical records found.

- Null values are retained, since they are still valid and can be included in the analysis without compromising data integrity.

### Data Validation

The following step will focus on data validation, ensuring that the data aligns with variation and distribution of data
